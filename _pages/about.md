My name is Colin Mason. I recently graduated from Brigham Young University where I received my Bachelor's of Science in Statistics and Psychology alongside a minor in Mathematics. 

My Interest in Data Science
======
I spend most of my time working on a variety of data science projects. It's often tough to choose a good project since there are so many great ideas out there with data science, but many of the projects here touch on a variety of domains that I have been curious about. 


My Interest in Psychology
======
My psychology degree has helped me find a passion in biomedical research. I've published research in the Journal of Neurochemistry.
